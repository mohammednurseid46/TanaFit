This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Frontend authentication

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to the
backend API root (including `/api/v1` for this backend). The default is
`http://localhost:8000/api/v1`.

The Next.js auth route handlers proxy registration, login, and profile requests
to the backend. The access token is stored in an `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`
cookie and is never exposed to browser JavaScript. Dashboard route groups
require a valid session and the matching role, and display the signed-in user's
profile. New registrations use the backend's default `MEMBER` role.

The backend access token expires after 30 minutes and does not implement token
refresh, so an expired session requires signing in again.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
